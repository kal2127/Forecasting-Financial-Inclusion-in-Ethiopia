Mobile Money Surge (2025): Total mobile money accounts in Ethiopia hit 139.5 million by early 2025 (up from almost zero in 2020).

Digital ID (Fayda): Over 24 million Ethiopians were enrolled in the Fayda Digital ID by late 2025. This is huge because you usually need an ID to open a bank account!

Smartphone Gap: While 94% of people have signal, only about 25% are regular internet users. This "usage gap" explains why account ownership isn't growing as fast as the number of SIM cards.

New Events to Add:
Fuel Digitization (August 2024): The government made it mandatory to pay for gas using mobile money. This forced millions of drivers to start using digital wallets.
