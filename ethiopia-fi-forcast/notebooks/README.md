******\_\_\_******New Observations to Add:********\_\_********
Mobile Money Surge (2025): Total mobile money accounts in Ethiopia hit 139.5 million by early 2025 (up from almost zero in 2020).

Digital ID (Fayda): Over 24 million Ethiopians were enrolled in the Fayda Digital ID by late 2025. This is huge because you usually need an ID to open a bank account!

Smartphone Gap: While 94% of people have signal, only about 25% are regular internet users. This "usage gap" explains why account ownership isn't growing as fast as the number of SIM cards.

******\_\_\_\_******New Events to Add:********\_\_********
Fuel Digitization (August 2024): The government made it mandatory to pay for gas using mobile money. This forced millions of drivers to start using digital wallets.

NDPS 2.0 Launch (Late 2025): The NBE launched the "National Digital Payments Strategy 2026–2030," which specifically targets the gender gap.

******\_******section: Key Insights & Findings****\_\_****
1, Stagnation Mystery: Despite a massive surge in mobile money (over 130M accounts), official account ownership only grew by 3 percentage points (46% to 49%) between 2021 and 2024. (See: Ownership Trajectory Plot).

2, The Registration Gap: There is a wide gap between people who have a SIM card registered for mobile money and people who report "owning" a financial account in surveys. (See: Mobile vs. Findex Comparison Table).

3, Digital Payment Leadership: Digital P2P transfers have now officially overtaken ATM withdrawals, signaling a shift in how Ethiopians spend money. (See: Transaction Volume Chart).

4, Policy Impacts: Mandatory digital payments for fuel (April 2024) created a visible "forced adoption" spike in usage data. (See: Event Timeline Overlay).

5, Gender Inclusion Gap: Growth remains uneven; men are significantly more likely to be banked than women, which is a major bottleneck for reaching 100% inclusion. (See: Gender Disaggregation Plot).

****\_****Section: Data Limitations******\_******-
Temporal Gaps: Findex data is only available every 3 years, meaning we have to estimate the "in-between" years.

Indicator Coverage: We lack detailed rural vs. urban data for 2024, which makes regional forecasting difficult.

Confidence levels: Some "event impact" data is based on early reports and is marked as "Medium Confidence" until more official stats are released in late 2026.
