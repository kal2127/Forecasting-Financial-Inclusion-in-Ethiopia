New Observations to Add:
Mobile Money Surge (2025): Total mobile money accounts in Ethiopia hit 139.5 million by early 2025 (up from almost zero in 2020).

Digital ID (Fayda): Over 24 million Ethiopians were enrolled in the Fayda Digital ID by late 2025. This is huge because you usually need an ID to open a bank account!

Smartphone Gap: While 94% of people have signal, only about 25% are regular internet users. This "usage gap" explains why account ownership isn't growing as fast as the number of SIM cards.

New Events to Add:
Fuel Digitization (August 2024): The government made it mandatory to pay for gas using mobile money. This forced millions of drivers to start using digital wallets.

NDPS 2.0 Launch (Late 2025): The NBE launched the "National Digital Payments Strategy 2026–2030," which specifically targets the gender gap.

key insights on task-2
1, The Growth Paradox: Even though Telebirr reached 54 million users, account ownership only grew by 3%. This suggests a "registered vs. active" gap.
2, P2P Dominance: In Ethiopia, digital transfers are now used for more than just sending money to friends; they have surpassed ATM cash withdrawals for buying things.
3, Low Digital Trust: Only about 9.45% of people report actually "owning" a mobile money account, even if they use digital payments.
4, Policy Power: Mandatory events, like fuel digitization, are likely big drivers for getting people to use their digital wallets for the first time.
5, Infrastructure Barriers: While phone use is high, internet access and 4G coverage are still "enablers" that limit how many people can use these apps easily.
